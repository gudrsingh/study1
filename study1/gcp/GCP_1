HA, Low Latency, Fault tolerance, auto scaling, load balancing, 
GCE (compute engine): provision & manage VM- create & manage lifecycle of VM
CE(compute engine) + PD (persistent disk) + CLB (cloud load balancer)

create & manage lifecycle of VM
Load balancing & autoscaling for VM
attach storage 
manage network connectivity & config (IP attach,subnets)

simplify VM http server setup - startup script- boot strapping - instance template - custom image

VM creation - 
machine family (determines cpu, RAM ,H/W)
            - general purpose (e2-std-2,4,8,16 cpu)
            - compute purpose (c2-std-4)
            - memory optimized (m2-std-4) - gpu
boot disk - image type (os & s/w) - public, custom, snapshot - linux, ubuntu, windows
management, security, disk, n/w, sole tenancy, firewall
        - automation - startup script

static IP - external IP - create static IP - change & assign - release
VM external IP - ephemeral - change on restart

instance templates - define m/c type, image, labels, startup script (can't be changed- copy & update- no region & zone)
managed instance groups (optional) - image family can be used

custom image-  with OS patches & S/W pre-installed
    - can be created from an instance, disk, snapshot, another image, file in cloud storage
    - can be shared across projects
    - can be deprecated
    - hardening an image - customize image to your corporate policy
to create VM from custom image - in boot disk select ur custom image
pre-emptible vm (in availability policy) - spot instance- short live, cheaper, 30 sec warning, 

live migration (or terminate or restart)- running instance will be migrated to same zone, to not down app while h/w or s/w upgrade- configured in availability policy

instance - image- instance template - instance group (auto scaling) - inst1, inst2
LB- instance group1 (inst1, inst2)
  - instance group2 (inst3, inst4)
