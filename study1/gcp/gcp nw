VPC-> Router + firewall + VPN + I/P N/W
BGP - broad g/w protocol
Interconnect - data migration, DR, replication  -> dedicated connection parameter
VLAN
Firewall - distributed firewall
    rule - 4 things
    action -> allow or deny
    protocol -> TCP, UDP, ICMP
    source/detination for rule

gcloud compute firewall-rules create http-allow-rule ___ directio = ingress __ 
    allow = TCP 22 __ target-tags = ref-tags

create FW - Name - , NW - vpc1, direction - Ingress/egress, Action - Allow/deny, Tags-
    source i/p range - 10.0.0.1/32, protocol - tcp, port - 5001

to handle ephemeral i/p issue use tags in f/w or L/B & L/B ICMP
shared vpc - share select  subnets or all
    host project - shared vpc   -> attach service project
    service project 
in service project VM - N/W - select shared n/w with M/C 
e.g. e-comm project (HR Admin Accounts DB ) all can access each other's VM N/W using shared vpc
& host project while having separate project mgmt, deployment, billing etc.

VPC peering - i/p range should not overlap
create peer vpc1 to vpc2  source/destination 1/2
create peer vpc2 to vpc1  source/destination 2/1

Traffic routing: static routing
    vpc routing - routing table
    every route consists of a destination and next hop 
    route order
dynamic routing
