strength and weaknesses - 
My strength is that I am adaptable to new things and I have zeal for new learnings. I am adaptable to new technology, new working environments. I am also self-motivated, flexible, and self-disciplined. 
My weakness is I find difficult to say No. As a result, I do overcommit sometimes. I take more on my plate than my capacity. Other weakness is overthinking, I get annoyed by unfinished work. Many times, you don't get a solution immediately and it takes time in finding the right solution but I start doing overthinking until I get the solution.
