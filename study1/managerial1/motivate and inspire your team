How do you motivate and inspire your team to achieve their goals?
As a manager, I believe in a combination of intrinsic and extrinsic motivation.
To inspire my team, I start by setting clear and achievable goals, ensuring that they align with the company's objectives and each team member's personal growth.
I foster a positive work environment where team members feel valued and heard. Recognizing and rewarding their efforts, whether through praise, promotions, or other incentives, plays a vital role in motivation.
I also encourage open communication, so team members feel comfortable sharing their ideas and concerns.
Additionally, I lead by example and am actively involved in the day-to-day tasks to demonstrate my commitment to the team's success.
