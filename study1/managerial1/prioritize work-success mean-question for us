How do you prioritize work for your team and yourself?
Ans: We follow the agile prcess with 2 week sprints. We reserve 50% capacity for planned activities and 50% for adhoc tasks. For planned activities, we discuss the backlog and take the planned tasks for the sprint. We follow kanban for tracking the tasks progress, team velocity etc. For adhoc, we deicde mostly in scrum call and some tasks we decide on pririty basis as and when they come. I regularly discuss priorities with my team to ensure that everyone understands the goal. We use jira for task management, create a worklist for each team member.
Determine which tasks are critical and schedule them accordingly.When assigning responsibilities, set a realistic time frame and be flexible
