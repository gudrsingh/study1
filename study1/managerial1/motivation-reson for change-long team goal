Motivation- What motivates you at work-> as part of devops team we work with teams from different domain and technology. It gives us ample of scope for learning new things. so challenges and learning opportunities motivates me lot.

Change- why do you want to chnage- one reason is I have learnt most of the things here in Merck so I think change will provide me new learnings and new challenges.

long-term career goals- technology has a limit to grow and at some point you will hit the roof. So I want to gather and grow people skills. So, the people skill combined with tech skills can give me opportunity to grow as a leader and I would like to gather a position where I work on company goals and strategies.
