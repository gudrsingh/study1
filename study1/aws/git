Visual Example

Suppose you have this history:

A---B---C (main)
     \
      D---E (feature)

==>Merge:

A---B---C------M (main)
     \      /
      D----E (feature)
(M is a merge commit)

==>Rebase (feature on main):
A---B---C---D'---E' (feature rebased)
(D’ and E’ are new commits)

===>Cherry-pick (E onto main):
A---B---C---E' (main)
     \
      D---E (feature)

(only E was copied to main as a new commit E’)
