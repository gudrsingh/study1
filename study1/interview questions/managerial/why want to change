"I have had the privilege of working in my current team for nearly six years, and I am truly grateful for the support and opportunities provided by my team, managers, and leaders. During this time, I have gained invaluable experience and knowledge. However, I am now eager to embrace new challenges that will further develop my skills, particularly in data engineering and AI.

Transitioning to this role excites me because I believe it will enable me to leverage my expertise to significantly enhance Merck's ability to extract meaningful insights from data. By providing the right infrastructure and services to the Healthcare team, I can contribute to our mission of improving patient outcomes.

I am enthusiastic about the opportunity to continue my journey within the Healthcare team in this new capacity and am committed to driving our shared success."
