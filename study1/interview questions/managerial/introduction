“Thank you for the opportunity. I’m Rohit Kumar, a DevOps & Cloud Architect with over 18 years of experience in IT, specializing in DevOps transformations, cloud adoption, and SecDevOps.

I started my career as a software engineer, working on C, C++, and Java, and gradually moved into automation and cloud engineering. Over the last decade, I’ve had the opportunity to lead large-scale migrations from on-premises to AWS and GCP, architect enterprise Kubernetes platforms across AWS EKS, Azure AKS, and GCP GKE, and design GitOps-driven CI/CD pipelines using ArgoCD, FluxCD, and Helm.

In my current role at Merck, I lead cloud engineering and DevOps initiatives. Some of my key contributions include:
Embedding SecDevOps practices across the SDLC, integrating tools like SonarQube, ZAP, and Kiuwan to improve compliance and code quality.
Designing multi-architecture container solutions (ARM64 + x86) for microservices, which improved cost efficiency and performance.
Enhancing observability using Prometheus, Grafana, Loki, and ELK, enabling proactive monitoring and faster incident response.
Driving automation that improved release velocity by 70% and reduced operational costs by 40%.

Beyond delivery, I’m passionate about mentoring teams, running DevOps workshops, and fostering a DevOps culture that aligns with business objectives. I’ve also been exploring Generative AI in DevOps — for example, contributing to hackathon projects and experimenting with AI-powered code assistants to optimize pipelines.

Overall, I bring a mix of hands-on technical depth in cloud, DevOps, and security, along with leadership experience in scaling teams and transforming ways of working. I’m excited about opportunities where I can apply this experience to build secure, scalable, and innovative cloud-native solutions.”
