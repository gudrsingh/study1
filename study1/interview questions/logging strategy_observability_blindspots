Good Logging Strategies
->Centralized logging
Collect logs from apps, infrastructure, network devices, and cloud services into a central system (ELK, Loki, CloudWatch, Datadog, Splunk).
This avoids chasing logs across nodes when debugging.
->Structured logging - Use JSON or another parseable format (not just free-text).
Include standard fields: timestamp, request_id, user_id, trace_id, severity, service, env.

Severity levels with discipline
DEBUG ‚Üí Dev troubleshooting
INFO ‚Üí State changes (startup/shutdown, config applied)
WARN ‚Üí Unexpected but non-fatal issues
ERROR ‚Üí Failures needing attention
FATAL ‚Üí System crash / unrecoverable

Correlation IDs / trace IDs
Propagate IDs across services (e.g., via headers like X-Request-ID).
Makes it possible to follow a single transaction end-to-end across microservices.

Context over noise
Log actionable events with enough metadata (user, env, operation).
Avoid dumping stack traces for expected errors (e.g., 404s on health checks).
Too much noise = real issues buried.

Log rotation and retention policies
Rotate logs to avoid disk pressure.

Keep short retention for DEBUG, longer for ERROR/FATAL.
Use lifecycle rules in storage (e.g., S3 IA / Glacier).

Security & compliance
Don‚Äôt log secrets, passwords, tokens, PII.
Mask sensitive fields.
Encrypt logs at rest and in transit.

Keep audit logs tamper-evident.

üîé Avoiding Observability Blind Spots
Full ‚Äúthree pillars‚Äù coverage
Logs (what happened),
Metrics (system health),
Traces (where latency/failure occurred).
Relying only on logs = partial picture.

Environment parity
Don‚Äôt just log in production. Enable logging in staging/QA with similar verbosity.
Prevents ‚Äúworks in staging, breaks in prod‚Äù without clues.

Distributed tracing
Without tracing, slow calls across microservices look like random spikes.
Use OpenTelemetry, Jaeger, X-Ray, or Tempo to tie logs/metrics together.

Health & audit logs
Many teams forget infra-level logs: load balancers, DNS, IAM, cloud control plane (CloudTrail).

Blind spots often come from ignoring non-app logs.

Error budgets for observability
Define SLOs for logging itself (e.g., 99.9% log delivery success).
Monitor log pipeline health ‚Äî a broken Fluentd/Vector agent = instant blind spot.

Cross-account / multi-region visibility
Centralize logs across regions/accounts. Blind spots often occur at boundaries.

Run ‚Äúgame days‚Äù
Simulate failures (disk full, API timeout, DB down).
See if you can detect and trace the issue from your logs/metrics.
Gaps found in drills are the blind spots you‚Äôd otherwise discover at 3 a.m.

‚ö°Ô∏è In short:

Log what matters (events, errors, changes).

Log it in a structured, centralized, and correlated way.

Continuously test your observability to surface blind spots before incidents do.
