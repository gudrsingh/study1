1. **Management Account**: Central control, consolidated billing, guardrails, and IAM Identity
Center. 2. **Security Account**: Centralized logging (CloudTrail, Config, GuardDuty), security
tooling (Security Hub, Inspector), and monitoring. 3. **Shared Services Account**: CI/CD pipelines,
centralized networking, DNS, directory services. 4. **Development Account**: Application
development and testing environments. 5. **Staging Account**: Pre-production workloads,
integration, and performance testing. 6. **Production Account**: Mission-critical workloads with
strict controls. 7. **Sandbox/Experiment Account**: For innovation and POCs with cost and access
controls.

- Enforce SCPs (Service Control Policies) for guardrails. - Centralize logging and monitoring in the
Security Account. - Automate provisioning with Infrastructure as Code (IaC). - Integrate CI/CD
pipelines with security scanning (SAST, DAST, IaC checks). - Apply least-privilege IAM and
role-based access. - Use AWS Config and Security Hub for continuous compliance. - Implement
cross-account role assumption with IAM Identity Center.
============================================================================
let’s design a pragmatic, security-first multi-account AWS architecture for a DevSecOps organization. I’ll give you:

A recommended account topology (who owns what),

Key services & controls per account,

Cross-account auth patterns for CI/CD and ops,

A deployment pipeline / shift-left checklist,

Concrete guardrails, automation & monitoring suggestions,

Success metrics and quick next steps.

1) Recommended account topology (high level)

Use AWS Organizations + Organizational Units (OUs). Each account has a single, focused purpose and strict boundaries.

Management / Organization Root

AWS Organizations master (not for workloads) — manage OUs, SCPs, account creation.

Security / Audit OU

Audit & Log Archive Account

Central CloudTrail (organization trail), all logs, immutable S3 bucket, long-term retention.

Security Tooling Account

GuardDuty, Security Hub, Inspector, SIEM connectors, investigation playbooks.

IAM / Identity Account (optional)

Central IAM Identity Center (AWS SSO) and identity lifecycle management integration (IdP).

Shared Services OU

Networking / Transit Account

Transit Gateway, centralized NAT, shared VPCs (if using), VPN/Direct Connect termination.

Platform / Shared Services Account

CI runners (if self-hosted), artifact stores, container registries that are shared, internal tooling (artifact repo, metering).

Workload OU(s)

Dev / Sandbox Account(s)

Developer experimentation, low trust. Short lived resources encouraged.

Test / QA / Staging Account(s)

Production-like environment for testing.

Pre-Prod Account (optional)

Prod Account(s)

Strict controls, restricted network, limited IAM access.

CI/CD Account (recommended)

Host ephemeral build agents / runners, pipelines that assume cross-account deploy roles into target accounts.

Notes: Number of accounts depends on team size/regulation. Use Account Factory (Control Tower) or automated provisioning (Terraform, AWS CDK, Landing Zone).

2) What belongs in each account — services & controls
Audit & Log Archive

Organization CloudTrail → centralized S3 bucket with server-side encryption (SSE-KMS).

Aggregated VPC Flow Logs, CloudWatch Logs, ALB logs, S3 access logs.

S3 bucket locked down (bucket policies, MFA delete or object lock if required).

KMS CMKs with strict key policies (only this account + security tools can use).

Long retention + life cycle rules (cold storage).

Security Tooling Account

Amazon GuardDuty, AWS Security Hub, Amazon Inspector — aggregated findings.

SIEM integration (Splunk/QRadar/Elastic) pulling from log archive or via Kinesis Data Firehose.

SOC automation (Lambda, Step Functions) for response playbooks.

IAM Access Analyzer, Detective (if used).

Ticketing/Incident integration (ServiceNow, PagerDuty).

Networking / Transit

Transit Gateway, VPC peering, centralized NAT/egress, shared services VPCs.

Network routing policies, firewall rules (Network Firewall), AWS WAF in front of shared apps.

PrivateLink endpoints for connecting platform services across accounts.

Shared Platform / Artifact

Amazon ECR repositories (image scanning enabled), artifact S3 buckets, private registries.

Artifact immutability policies, SBOM storage.

Docker image signing (registry scanning + signing via cosign/Notary).

Secrets manager for platform-level secrets (encrypted with customer-managed KMS keys).

CI/CD Account

AWS CodeBuild / GitHub Actions runners (self-hosted in ENIs), or runner fleet in this account.

Pipelines trigger cross-account assume-role into target account(s) for deployment.

Least-privileged IAM roles for pipeline execution; ephemeral creds.

Workload Accounts (Dev/Test/Prod)

Application workloads only.

IAM roles limited; only specific principals (CI/CD account roles, admin users from IAM Identity Center with MFA).

VPC design: private subnets for workloads, public only for necessary endpoints.

Use Security Groups + NACLs minimally; rely on Network Firewall/Transit Gateway for cross-account egress controls.

3) Cross-account auth & deployment patterns

Identity: Centralize human identity with AWS IAM Identity Center (SSO) integrated with corporate IdP (Okta, Azure AD).

Machine identity: Use short-lived role assumption: CI/CD account holds pipeline; when deploying, pipeline calls sts:AssumeRole into a narrowly-scoped role in target account (trust only pipeline principal).

Permission boundaries & SCPs: Use SCPs to deny dangerous actions (e.g., disabling CloudTrail, creating public S3 buckets), even if account-admins have IAM permissions.

Least privilege roles: Create environment-specific deploy roles (deploy-role-prod, deploy-role-staging) with narrow resource ARNs.

Logging of AssumeRole: Enable detailed CloudTrail and alert on unusual assume-role usage.

4) DevSecOps pipeline: shift-left & automated checks

Implement checks in this order inside CI pipeline:

Pre-commit / PR checks

SAST (static code analysis) + secret scanning (git-secrets, TruffleHog).

IaC lint & security checks: tfsec, Checkov, cfn-nag.

Dependency scanning & SBOM generation (e.g., CycloneDX, OWASP Dependency-Check).

Container image build with reproducible builds and image signing.

Build

Build artifacts in CI/CD account, sign artifacts, scan images with ECR scanning and Clair/Trivy.

Record SBOM and artifact metadata into artifact registry.

Pre-deploy

Policy-as-code checks (OPA/Rego, Sentinel) to enforce org policies (allowed regions, instance types).

Automated acceptance tests and security tests (DAST in staging).

Deploy

Pipeline assumes deploy role into target account to deploy.

Post-deploy verification: smoke tests, runtime security checks.

Post-deploy monitoring

Runtime vulnerability scans, runtime protection (Falco, runtime EDR), observability.

5) Guardrails, detection & automated remediation
Guardrails (preventive)

SCPs at OU level to enforce: deny deletion of control plane logs, deny public S3 by default, deny wide * IAM policies, deny root access to console.

IAM permission boundaries and role session duration limits.

Service Control Policies + Config Rules to enforce required controls.

Detection

Centralized CloudTrail (Org) with real-time alerts for risky actions.

AWS Config aggregated rules + remediation (auto-remediate non-compliant resources).

GuardDuty + Security Hub aggregator.

Automated Remediation

AWS Config remediation (Lambda), SSM Automation for patching.

Playbooks in Security Account: isolate instance, revoke keys, revoke role sessions, rotate secrets.

6) Data protection & key management

One CMK per purpose and account? Prefer centralized KMS in security account with grants to other accounts — or use account-scoped CMKs with key policies carefully configured.

Encrypt S3 with SSE-KMS, RDS and EBS with KMS CMKs.

Secrets stored in AWS Secrets Manager with rotation enabled for DB credentials and service accounts.

Limit access via resource-based policies and IAM conditions (e.g., aws:SourceAccount, aws:SourceVpc).

7) Network design & connectivity

Zero trust: default deny, least privilege at network layer.

Private subnets for workloads; NAT or egress proxy in Network account.

Service endpoints (VPC endpoints) to talk to AWS APIs privately.

Transit Gateway for scale; route tables + firewall policies for segmentation.

Use AWS Network Firewall or third-party firewall in Transit account for egress filtering.

8) Operational practices & hygiene

Account provisioning automation: Control Tower + Account Factory or Terraform + AWS Organizations automation.

Golden AMIs / Immutable infra: Bake hardened images (SSM, image pipeline).

Patch management: SSM Patch Manager across accounts from central operations.

Bastion / Session Manager: Prefer SSM Session Manager over bastion hosts; log all sessions to central logs.

Backups: Centralized backup policies (AWS Backup account), cross-account access for restores.

9) Compliance & auditing

Aggregated AWS Config & CloudTrail => proof for auditors.

Tagging enforced by policy and validated in pipelines.

Periodic drift detection and snapshotting of infra for audit.

Retention policies for logs based on compliance (e.g., 1–7 years).

10) Example SCPs & Controls (conceptual)

Deny s3:PutBucketPublicAccessBlock if it opens public.

Deny iam:CreatePolicy with * in actions or resources.

Require CloudTrail for all regions.

Deny kms:DisableKey for audit keys.

(Implement carefully; test in dev OU before global rollout.)

11) Metrics & KPIs to measure success

MTTR (Mean Time To Recovery) — aim to decrease with automated remediation.

Time-to-deploy and lead time for changes — measure Dev productivity.

Number of high-severity vulnerabilities in production (should trend down).

% of builds/pipelines failing due to security checks — track earlier detection.

Number of remediation automations executed per week — successful playbooks.

12) Quick implementation roadmap (rollout plan)

Set up AWS Organizations + OUs; create baseline accounts (Audit, Security, Network, CI/CD, Prod, Dev).

Deploy central CloudTrail -> Log Archive and KMS setup.

Enable AWS Config aggregator and guard duty in Security account.

Create CI/CD account and implement cross-account deploy roles.

Integrate SAST/IaC scanning in pipeline; block PR merges on high severity.

Roll out SCPs incrementally; test in Dev OU.

Implement centralized alerting + SIEM.

Iterate: add automated remediations and refine least privilege.

Diagram (verbal)

Think of concentric rings:

Outer ring: Organization / SCPs

Next ring: Security & Audit (central logging, SIEM)

Middle ring: Shared services (Transit, Platform, CI/CD)

Inner ring: Workload accounts (Dev → Staging → Prod)
Arrows: CI/CD account → assume-role → Workload accounts. Logs flow from all accounts → Log Archive → Security SIEM.

Final tips / gotchas

Test SCPs and permission boundaries in a sandbox first — SCPs can lock you out.

Use “deny” SCPs for absolute must-not-dos (e.g., disable CloudTrail).

Prefer short-lived credentials and automated secrets rotation.

Keep human administrative access minimal and on-boarding via IAM Identity Center.

Keep the least privilege everywhere — it’s easier to relax permissions than to tighten after a breach.

If you want, I can:

Produce a diagram (PNG/SVG) of the above topology,

Generate a starter Terraform / AWS CDK scaffolding for the accounts (Control Tower + Account Factory),

Provide example IAM role trust policy and an SCP JSON you can test.

Which of those would help you next?
